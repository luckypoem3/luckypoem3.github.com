Oh Great Firewall shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<br>
No, I shalt compare thee to a thorn in my backside.<br>
<br>
Thou art more restrictive and more disruptive.<br>
Rough connections do shake the darling congress of March,<br>
And 1989's memory hath all too long a block.<br>
Sometime too hot the eye of CPC shines,<br>
And often is Youtube's complexion dimmed;<br>
And every post from BBS sometime declines,<br>
By chance, or golden shield's changing course, untrimmed;<br>
But thy eternal censor shall not fade,<br>
Nor lose possession of that power thou ow'st,<br>
Nor shall freedom brag thou wand'rest in his shade,<br>
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.<br>
<br>
So long as men can browse, or hands can type,<br>
So long lives this, and this gives frustration to thee
